## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter while using Sana and how to resolve them:

### General Issues

**Question:** Sana doesn't start when I double-click the executable. What should I do?

**Answer:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the executable. If you're on macOS, you might need to allow the app to run in your System Preferences under Security & Privacy.

**Question:** I've unzipped the Sana package, but the 'sana_temple' or 'cyphers' directories are missing. What should I do?

**Answer:** The 'sana_temple' and 'cyphers' directories should be created automatically when you run Sana. If they're not, please check your permissions for the directory where Sana is located.

**Question:** I'm trying to run Sana in a context where I can't provide user input (like a background task or a system startup script). What should I do?

**Answer:** Currently, Sana requires user input to run. If you need to run Sana in a context where user input isn't possible, please contact us for further assistance.

### macOS Issues

**Question:** I get a warning that says "Sana can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer." What should I do?

**Answer:** This is a security feature of macOS. You can open the app by going to your System Preferences, clicking on Security & Privacy, and then clicking "Open Anyway".

### Windows Issues

**Question:** I get a warning from Windows Defender SmartScreen. What should I do?

**Answer:** This is a security feature of Windows. You can still run the app by clicking on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

**Question:** My antivirus software is flagging Sana as a virus. What should I do?

**Answer:** Sana is not a virus, but because it's a script that interacts with your file system, some antivirus software might flag it as suspicious. If this happens, you can add an exception for Sana in your antivirus software.
