# Sana - Simula - A Whole New World

Sana, meaning "to hope for" or "wish" in tagalog, is a proof of concept for a new, more open framework for NFTs. The entire world of Sana is curated and can be edited by you, the user. This is our hopeful vision for the future of NFTs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Sana, simply open the appropriate executable for your operating system:

- For macOS users, open `sana_mac_os`
- For Windows users, open `sana_windows.exe`

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter while using Sana and how to resolve them:

### General Issues

**Issue:** Sana doesn't start when I double-click the executable.

**Solution:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run the executable. If you're on macOS, you might need to allow the app to run in your System Preferences under Security & Privacy.

### macOS Issues

**Issue:** I get a warning that says "Sana can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."

**Solution:** This is a security feature of macOS. You can open the app by going to your System Preferences, clicking on Security & Privacy, and then clicking "Open Anyway".

### Windows Issues

**Issue:** I get a warning from Windows Defender SmartScreen.

**Solution:** This is a security feature of Windows. You can still run the app by clicking on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

If you're still having trouble, please open an issue or dm me on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ghouliemac) page I'll be happy to help.
